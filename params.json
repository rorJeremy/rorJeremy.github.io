{"name":"A Purpose Driven Tech Blog","tagline":"What Is The Purpose","body":"### Welcome To My Official Tech Blog!\r\n\r\nWhen I started interning at <a href=\"http://www.kalkomey.com/\">Kalkomey</a>, I didn't have a lot of app development experience. It didn't take me very long to realize that the key to learning is really to just do it. Practice and being consistent with your effort eventually leads to experience which is followed by skill. Moreover, what I learn builds on itself. Having a solid foundation to build on is key on your quest to become an expert in any field, especially programming.\r\n\r\nTo that end, as a pretty raw intern with Kalkomey, I immediately started learning as much as I could. There are plenty of good resources out there for learning all the ways of app development; however, as a beginner, I found that some were either too technical, or too basic and just plain boring. I wished there was a tutorial that laid things out in a way that I understood and that would provide for me a solid foundation to build on.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me here, to write my own. The act of writing reinforces what you know by challenging you to explain it in the simplest way possible. One of the things Kalkomey really encourages it's developers on, is to always write clear documentation for your work, so that if someone else has to pick up your project in the future, they'll have a good source to reference to. It was while writing documentation for my own projects that I realized the benefits of writing, and explaining your work. After writing, I always felt like I gained a stronger grasp on what I already knew, as well as even learning a few new things along the way. Compiling information and writing it down gives you the opportunity to find out what you know and what you don't know.\r\n\r\nI initially intended this blog to only cover introductory level topics that I would write myself, but I've now decided to go a different route, and partner with a friend of mine who also interned with me at Kalkomey. <a href=\"https://github.com/mlohstroh\">Mark Lohstroh</a> and I will both contribute posts to this blog. Since he's a more advanced programmer than I am, you can expect a wider range of topics for him to cover in his posts, which should give a better balance to this blog overall. \r\n\r\nSo if you found this blog and didn't know anything about app development, I hope that after reading you have a firm understanding of the topics we cover. If you're already familiar with some of the topics, I hope you can at least learn some new tricks. I know I will!\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-46973809-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
